# üå± Talking Plants
Notifies you when your plants need your attention. 

Check out the web demo: [talkingplants.daae.dev](https://talkingplants.daae.dev).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation / Development Setup
Follow this simple 12 step guide to get started! *I recommend hosting the database and rest api on Heroku and the react app on netlify (because this repo contains a lot of the necessary configuration for these).* App sepecific instructions are intended for android, iOS has not been tested yet.

1. `sql/`: Setup a postgres database and run the sql scripts.
2. `api/`: Find a nice place to host the rest api.
3. Add all necessary variables to the environment where the api is running. These are specified in `api/.env.example`. *Note that some hosting platforms specify the port environment variable themselve.* If you are running the api locally you can add the variables to a `.env` file similar to the example file.
4. Wire up your arduino: *TBA*
5. `arduino/arduino_mkr_1010`: In this folder, create a file names `config.h`. The content should look like this:
```c++
#define WIFI_SSID "wifiname"
#define WIFI_PASS "wifipassword"
#define API_KEY "apikey"
#define PLANT_ID "42"
#define API_HOST "example.com"
```
5. You can use the Arduino IDE to upload the sketch to your arduino.
6. Find a nice place to host the web app.
7. Update `web/.env` to point to where you are hosting the api.
8. Create a firebase project (and upgrade to blaze plant).
9. Set the default GCP resource location in project settings.
10. Create `notifier/functions/.env`, similar to `notifier/functions/.env.example`.
11. Go into `notifier/` (which is the firebase project root) and deploy to your own firebase instance.
12. Configure the app to talk to your firebase project. There are plenty of resources on how to do this. Essentially what you have to do is to get the `google-services.json` file.

## üöÄ Deployment (may not apply to your hosting choices)
### Rest API

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/02c0eaf5-91c5-4218-8146-c5b2c9b1ee52/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/confident-newton-786803/deploys)

* https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/sectorlabs/heroku-buildpack-subdir
* https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust
* Add required environment variables (specified in .env.example) in `Settings/Config Vars` in Heroku
* `git push heroku master`

### Web
Deploys triggered in netlify on new commits to master.

### Arduino
Use the Arduino IDE.

### Notfier
`firebase deploy --only functions`

## üò† Troubleshooting
### Arduino
* Use `lsusb` to check if the arduino is actually connected to usb.
* Press the reset button on the arduino to restart the sketch.
* Doubletap the reset button if you are not able to upload new code.
