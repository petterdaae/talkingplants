# Achievements today
- Li-Po Battery is rechargeable when plugged into the arduino at the same time as usb
- It is possible to detect if the Li-Po battery is connected to the arduino
- Discovered arduino deep sleep library
    - Still have to turn off sensors and modules manually
    - Possibly use a transitor
    - The output that the transitor needs from the board is extremely low
    - So this *may* not affect the battery life time even if it's always on
- Discovered how to use a multimeter
    - The moisture sensor is using more power than expected
    - When no moisture: 1.5x20ma, when more: up to and probably more than 10+20ma

# Next time
- Is it possible to detect if usb is plugged in?
- Is it possible to meassure how much power is going through a circuit (on the board, without a multimeter)?
- Is it possible to limit the power that is going through a circuit?
- Try to connect the Li-Po battery manually. This might make it possible to meassure the total power consumption with a multimeter when it's in sleep/not in sleep.
- Is it possible to detect when a Li-Po battery is full?


- Measure how much power comes from the battery
- Try some other power bank
- Transistor before sensor
