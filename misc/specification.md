# Specification

## Abstract

In this project I aim to create some application that notifies me when I should water my plants.


## Step 0 - 1 week

* Test some soil moisture sensors
* Write Arduino code that makes a light blink when the moisture is beneath some treshold


## Step 1 - 3 weeks

* Write Arduino code that logs sensor values (to a database) for a longer period of time 
* Make a REST API and a web app that vizualizes the data in the database


## Step 2 - 5 weeks

* This is an experimental phase
* Try to determine when different plants need water
* Maybe add more sensors (light, temperature)


## Step 3 - 3 weeks

* Make a mobile application that gives notifications OR make the backend send me emails


## Step 4 - If I have more time

* Try to make the arduino and sensors look nice
* 3D printing?
